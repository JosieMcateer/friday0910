# How I expected the challenge to go. 

I have found JS & HTML ok, so i expected the challenge to be do-able with a bit of research.

# What went well?
The basic functions of the calculator went really well and i tried it in both formats- div, and table <tr> <td>.

# What didn't go as planned? 

The M functions were hard to figure out. i worked with Anthony and Oliver and we had to pull our brains together to see how these worked but these took the most time. 

# Possible improvements for future challenges

Remember that i have other code to refer back to.
